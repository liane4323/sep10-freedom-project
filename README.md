# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Lian Edhah**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **fashion**. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **Wow.Js and Animate.css** in order to help me make by website.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Social
  * individual
  * relationships
  * culture
* Global
  * big systems
  * environment

##### CONS
* Economic
  * Jobs
      * Technology in fashion could have negative effects on human employment. This is because robots might replace human jobs in the future, a concept that is already happening. For instance, self-checkout stations in supermarkets and automated parking ticket systems in malls are examples of technology taking over jobs that were once done by people. As a result, many people could lose their jobs to technological advancements.
