## Content
In this entry:
1. Brainstormed possible inventions 
2. Finalize the content that I will be putting on my website. 

### Brainstorming Possible Inventions 

I had an idea for possible inventions of hardware and software using <ins>[inspiration](https://chanryc9471.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/#hardware)</ins> from a previous student. I thought about the outfit issues that most of us deal with daily and how we may approach the problem to make our lives easier.

 Below is my initial brainstorming of these inventions:

 **Software**
- _Virtual Mannequin_

This software is a 3d program that allows you to preview different designs and clothing on a mannequin. You can adjust the shape/size of the mannequin to your liking in order to see how it fits in all sizes. This is very helpful when you want to see different designs on different body types. Which also takes up less of your time compared to sketching everything. 


**Hardware** 

- _IT bot_

This is a robot, sort of like Wall-E in Disney. It can speak any language. 
You can ask this bot what outfit is best fit for you. _IT_ even checks the weather and picks what is appropriate. 
This bot may become your best friend, it is available anytime and it can charge itself. The IT bot can also color-match your skin tone and give you personal suggestions for a glow-up!



### Website content 

In class, we were assigned to come up with the content that will go on our website. I combined the research that I conducted on _present inventions_ with my brainstorming on _possible inventions_. The website content wasn't challenging for me in any way because, I was very self-disciplined with my classwork and homework. I got everything that I needed to do out of the way so my content process could be steadfast. 

## [EDP](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp) (Engineering Design Process)

I am currently in step 3 of the EDP which is, **"Brainstorm possible solutions"**. I came up with one software and one hardware possible solutions which is stated above in my content section. 

## Skill
In this third entry, I would like to reflect on a skill that I believe I touched upon. 

### Self-Discipline

I believe that I worked on this skill because I made it my respsibility to complete my priority tasks first and give in my full effort. If I failed to do so, I took away the things that distracted me. For instance, I remember when I was in the process of completing my FP (freedom project) content, I got distracted by my phone for a period of 2 hours. I let myself waste 120 minutes instead of doing something productive. I felt unpleasent with my actions. I decided to step up and take action so I can ensure that I won't get distracted. I gave my phone to my sister to hold it for me until I was done with what I needed to complete. As a result, this occurrence made me wake up to my senses and see how important it is to have boundaries and limits within ourselves.

## Next Steps 

Now I am ready to _**plan**_ promising solutions.
