## Content

In this blog, I will be sharing the process that I went through when learning the tools that I chose for this project. Animate.CSS + Wow.JSb are the tools that I picked to learn on my own.


##### [WowJS](https://wowjs.uk/): a Javascript library that generates CSS animations as you are scrolling on a webpage.


##### [AnimateCSS](https://animate.style/): a library with animations that allow you to animate your webpage in any way you would like.


### Learning Logs

While learning the tools that I chose, I filled out [learning logs](../tool/learning-log.md). These learning logs helped me reflect and jot down what I have been working on without losing track. The top goal that I had in mind was to create an independent web page. I customized this website and added some things that I liked.  My MVP is to at least make 3 things animated, but I managed to animate more than that.

Here is a screenshot of an agenda for my webpage:

## [EDP](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp) (Engineering Design Process)

I am currently in step 5 of the EDP which is, **"create a prototype"**. I implemented my learning on a [_web page_](https://liane4323.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/tool/) that I created from scratch. This website allowed me to practice my HTML and CSS skills whilst reflecting on the learning of my tools. I will input my practice on this web page and use it in my Freedom Project Website!




## Skills


### Growth Mindset
I believe that I touched up on this skill because I used new techniques that would help me complete my LOYO days. At first when I was assigned to learn on my own I completely forgot that I had to work on my independent learning. I tried these two techniques that were recommended by my peers in order to help me out.


1. Using the notes app on my iPhone
2. Utilizing a whiteboard


The first recommended technique was a complete fail for me. I wrote down what I wanted to get done for the day, however I forgot to work on my prompts. When I tried the whiteboard technique, I didn't forget a thing. I bought a whiteboard and put it next to my bed. Whenever I entered my room, I got reminded to work on the tasks that I had written down.


### Time Management
I believe that I touched upon this skill because I prioritize my tasks. For example, when I know that an assignment is due at 11:59 tonight and an assignment due next week, I completed the assignment that was due at 11:59. Managing my time helped me get a lot of things done properly, I even have time to work on other things rather than procrastinating.
