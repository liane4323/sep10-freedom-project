# Entry 7 â™¡

## Content
In this blog, I will be sharing the final steps that I went through when presenting my project. I got to present to my class and be included in the expo. I will also be commenting on the key takeaways I have gained from this experience.

### In-Class presentation
I was one of the students that presented on the first day of in-class presentations before the elevator pitch. This was very important to be because I chose to gulp down any fear of standing in front of a crowd and speaking. I was very comfortable with my crowd because we were all learning together and I made good friends along the way. This in-class presentation allowed me to get to know what it feels to present in front of peolpe and it was very good practice for me. A takeaway for me is to try and focus on the process of how I got my final during my presentation. Takeaways of my process during the in-class presentations would have made my presentation a 10/10. Next time I will be sure to include these two in order to improve.

### Expo elevator pitch
At the beginning of this event I was very stressed out. I overwhelmed myself by overthinking things that might go wrong. Although I was fully prepared for the expo because of my in-class presentation, at the end of this I thought that everything ran smoothly. Although next time I could improve on a thing or two. One main thing that I would like to improve on is allowing myself to engage with the audience a bit more instead of reading off my computer screen. I should allow them to have a proper conversation about my final freedom project result. Everything went great during the expo, and I do believe that my in-class presentation helped with the way I presented myself. A takeaway that I have is to not overwhelm yourself with excessive thoughts. The stress can cause you to have brain fog and mess up when you are presenting.  Overall, I hope next year I can use these main topics and improve!


## [EDP](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp) (Engineering Design Process)

Since we are at the end of this school year, we have made it to step 8 of the EDP which is, **"communicate the results"**. I was allowed to communicate my results by presenting in-class and in the expo. This last step was very relaxing because of all the hard work that I went through. In the end I am satisfied with the final product.

## Skills

In this final entry, I would like to reflect on two skills that I believe I touched upon.

### Communication
Communication is a main skill that I gained along the way. I had the opportunity to present my final project to different audience several times.  When I first started SEP I was very hesitant about the whole communication factor. However, from the beginning of the year to now, I have seen significant growth in my overall communication abilities. I hope to see more growth throughout the next years in SEP!

### Logical reasoning

 I believe that my logical reasoning skills were put to the test. I say this because I was asked unexpected questions that required quick thinking. For instance, someone asked me about the errors I had overcome. While this first question was straightforward, the follow-up question was challenging: "What life lesson can you gain from this error?" It took me a few seconds to find a response, but I eventually managed to answer the question thoroughly. These type of questions allowed me to use logical reasoning.

## Sources
