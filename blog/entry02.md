## Content 
During my research I came across many websites, some were helpful and the others served no purpose. Even though the research I did was a little difficult, I found a lot of excellent sources. I started by searching for fashion hardware, but it didn't help, all I got were pointless webpages. I came to see how important it is to use appropriate vocabulary. I finally typed fashion hardware technology and got what I needed after a lot of trial and error. I clicked on [Technology for Fashion](https://fashiondesignlab.com/technology-for-fashion/). This webpage provides an introduction to the material and techniques covered in a class. It shows that production and design skills are being developed through making use of hardware and software. They also listed out different **vertical software** and **horizontal software** products being used. I continued my research after taking notes about the previous website. The second website I came across is called [Smart Fashion Accessories](https://medium.com/@geeksempire/smart-fashion-accessories-5-fashionable-and-stylish-tech-accessories-1c71905441d8), and it caught my attention due to the gadgets it featured as well as how minimalistic and ad-free it was. Although this website featured five gadgets, I will choose the three that most immediately grabbed my attention. 

### **_Invisawear Jewlery_**

A company called Invisawear produces jewelry that has the power to save lives. The reason smart jewelry is so amazing is that it is both useful as well as fashionable! You may even make a 911 call by double-pressing the back of a charm to let someone know where you are. This device uses **bluetooth low energy** and needs the installation of an app on your phone for it to work.

### **_Bose Frame_**

Bose frames are audio sunglasses, however, they can connect to Bluetooth from your phone and complete the same usage as headphones! Instead of ruining your look with bulky headphones, bose frames provide the same service that not only makes you look good, but feel good. These chic shades have built-in microphones and concealed speakers that are only accessible to YOUR ears. The hardware of these sunglasses includes the batteries, frame design, and audio components. The software of these sunglasses are the voice assistants and the Base connection app. 

### **_Smart LB Wallet_**

Some people feel that a wallet completes their look, however, losing it can be annoying. This device is useful for more than just looking fly. Your wallet can be monitored by the Smart Anti-Lost Wallet, which allows you to utilize your phone to set off an alarm if it gets lost. It maintains a connection from your phone to your wallet via Bluetooth. By detecting its location, this smart device prevents theft or loss. In the unlikely event that you misplace your wallet, there is an extra function that causes your phone to vibrate. 
 
The gadgets described above are brilliant and extremely beneficial including the usage of software and hardware, yet many fashion industry fail to take full advantage of technology.

## EDP (Engineering Design Process) 
 
In my engineering design process, I touched up on stage two (research the problem) from my first entry. I attempted to use technology to look up modesty in the fashion industry, but I was unable to gather information. This occurrance was because of the fact that no industry/company works with technology. After this entry, I would like to start the process of brainstorming solutions to come up with a fix to this dilemma. I have a few ideas in mind already, which I will be jotting down on my notes. 

## Skills
In this second entry, I would like to reflect on two skills that I believe I touched on. 

### **Embracing failure**

I believe I touched on this skill since it was extremely challenging for me to come across anything on modesty in the fashion industry **with** the usage of technology during my research. Although it wasn't impossible, I did stumble upon one website focused on modesty in the fashion industry with the use of technology, however it was very shady. I used common sense to acknowledge the fact that I shouldn't trust this website. The website was very cluttered, with pop-ups constantly appearing for you to sign up as you scrolled. It also felt off with the amount of ads that were displayed. Also, the diction that was chosen for the very weak information that was given was very poor. I'm glad I found this struggle because, without it, I couldn't have determined whether the previous website was a trustworthy source. 

### **Organization** 

The skill of organization played a big role in this stage of my EDP. I say this because as I was roaming around websites, I lost track of where I was and what I was reading. I opened so many tabs that I could only preview the icons on the top because of the clutter. As I went to my next classes, I felt overwhelmed as if my thoughts were everywhere. As soon as I got home I knew I had to tackle this problem.  I didn't want to close any tabs in case I would write about them so instead I took my time to X out the irrelevant tabs. After this, I created a group for all of these tabs and named it "research". As school days passed, I continued to work on my research and kept those websites in the research group. I use my personal computer for all my classes, so with the help of these groups, I wasn't concerned that my assignments from different classes would get mixed up. I felt relieved because a tidy workspace helps my thoughts to flow more easily.  

## Next Steps 
Now I am ready to _**brainstorm**_ possible solutions
