## Content 
Even though the research I did was a little difficult, I found a lot of excellent sources. I started by searching for fashion hardware, but it didn't help, all I got were pointless webpages. I came to see how important it is to use appropriate vocabulary. I finally typed fashion hardware technology and got what I needed after a lot of trial and error. I clicked on [Technology for Fashion](https://fashiondesignlab.com/technology-for-fashion/). This webpage provides an introduction to the material and techniques covered in a class. It shows that production and design skills are being developed through making use of hardware and software. They also listed out different **vertical software** and **horizontal software** products being used. I continued my research after taking notes about the previous website. The second website I came across is called [Smart Fashion Accessories](https://medium.com/@geeksempire/smart-fashion-accessories-5-fashionable-and-stylish-tech-accessories-1c71905441d8), and it caught my attention due to the gadgets it featured as well as how minimalistic and ad-free it was. Although this website featured five gadgets, I will choose the three that most immediately grabbed my attention. 

### **_Invisawear Jewlery_**

A company called Invisawear produces jewelry that has the power to save lives. The reason smart jewelry is so amazing is that it is both useful as well as fashionable! You may even make a 911 call by double-pressing the back of a charm to let someone know where you are. This device uses **bluetooth low energy** and needs the installation of an app on your phone for it to work.

### **_Bose Frame_**

Bose frames are sunglasses, however, they can connect to Bluetooth from your phone and complete the same usage as headphones! Instead of ruining your look with bulky headphones, bose frames provide the same service that not only makes you look good, but feel good.  These chic shades have built-in microphones and concealed speakers that are only accessible to YOUR ears.  

### **_Smart LB Wallet_**

Some people feel that a wallet completes their look, however, losing it can be annoying. This device is useful for more than just looking fly. Your wallet can be monitored by the Smart Anti-Lost Wallet, which allows you to utilize your phone to set off an alarm if it gets lost. It maintains a connection from your phone to your wallet via Bluetooth. By detecting its location, this smart device prevents theft or loss. In the unlikely event that you misplace your wallet, there is an extra function that causes your phone to vibrate.
