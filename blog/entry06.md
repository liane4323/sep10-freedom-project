# Entry 6 â™¡
##### 5/2/24

## Content
In this blog, I will be sharing the process that I went through when making my freedom project website. I used basic HTML, CSS, Animate.CSS, and Wow.JS. Animate.CSS and Wow.JS are the new tools that I learned on my own. I chose to learn these tools because I like the way that they function on websites. I believe that my MVP looks good and neat, the animations make everything look smooth as well. I am really proud of the final look!


## [EDP](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp) (Engineering Design Process)

I am currently in step 6 of the EDP which is, **"test and evaluate the prototype"**. I created my [freedom project webpage](https://liane4323.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/), this webpage includes all my research and information that I have been gathering about my topic (fashion). I used my prototype webpage that I created when I was learning my tools for refrence and guidance. I believe that everything went smoothly during this step.

## Skills
In this sixth entry, I would like to reflect on two skills that I believe I touched upon.


#### Organization
I believe that I touched upon organization because I was consistant with my time and learning. I have this schedule that I followed every weekday to ensure that I have time to finish my work for every class. So far it is working pretty good. This is a summary of my schedule after school.

1. 30 min nap after school
2. Quick nutritious snack
3. Create a to-do list of the things I **need** to get done
4. Tackle the to-do list

#### Attention to detail

I believe that I touched upon the skill of attention to detail. When I was working on the MVP of my webpage I payed close attention to what I was working on and focused on finishing it completely. For example, my first step of my webpage was to create my header and navbar. I made sure to finish these two and make sure that my navbar is functioning before I moved on to my h1s. I would continue using the same method while coding, as I was doing this I ensured total completion.
