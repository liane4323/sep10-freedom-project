## Choosing a topic
The topic that I chose for this freedom project is fashion. It took me a while debating with myself on what I should choose from my top 3, which is fashion, sports, and cooking. I was initially about to work with sports because I used to find passion in playing but as soon as I entered 9th grade I kind of drifted apart from this hobby. I am not really a good cook but I like trying, learning new techniques is always fun for me. I deepened my thoughts on these options, and later chose fashion. When someone looks at me they know right away that I am a muslim woman because of my head scarf. Every day I have to pick a good outfit that will cover me properly. There are some failures here and there, which is why I finalize my decision on fashion. I want to come up with new technology that could help out people that want to dress up modestly. During my research about this I was able to find two articles that I found interesting reading, ["The State of Today's Modest Fashion Market"](https://www.istitutomarangoni.com/en/maze35/industry/the-state-of-todays-modest-fashion-market) by Istituto Marangoni and ["Are Headscarves Only Cool When They’re on the Runway?"](https://www.thecut.com/2021/10/headscarves-paris-fashion-week.html#:~:text=Over%20the%20last%20several%20years,national%20and%20international%20brand%20campaigns) by The Cut. These articles made me interested to dig into this project more, however ["How Modest Fashion is Evolving and Being Embraced By Women All Around the World"](https://en.vogue.me/fashion/modest-fashion-global-importance-evolution-dulce-by-safiya-chador/) by Safiya Chador in Vogue made this topic click for me. Seeing how modesty was occuring in the fashion industry striked me with inspiration. 

## EDP (Engineering Design Process)
In this stage the task was to do research about my topic, now it is my job to define the problem. The issue I want to address is  **modesty in the fashion world**

## Skills 

I learnt 2 skills on the duration of making this blog which are, critical thinking and decision making. 

#### **Critical Thinking**
During the research I conducted, I had to analyze different websites and question myself if they are credible enough to use. I was aware that a website needed authority, sources, and a domain name check to be considered legitimate. I came across a webpage that provided me with excellent context, but as I was reading it, I kept getting a ridiculous amount of pop-up ads. This indicated that the website was a bit shady. After having to dismiss a whole lot of websites I later on found my 3 trustworthy websites I needed.
 
#### **Decision Making**
My initial idea for this blog was to write about cooking or sports. I never even considered using fashion as my topic. When I was brainstorming later at home to come up with three subjects to choose from, I thought about something that is really significant to me and my daily life, **_fashion_**. I thought about how much I value my clothing, at first  I was hesitant to choose this topic, but then I remembered how important this topic is to me. I used logic to pick out what I was passionate about, I asked myself these two questions... "Why would I choose sports if I stopped playing them?" and "If I am such a bad cook, then why would I choose cooking for my topic?". If I continue to use this logic every day and for future projects, I will be able to correctly pick what is good for me.

## Next steps 
I am prepared to start my research on possible technologies in fashion.
