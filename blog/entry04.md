## Content

In this blog, my goal is to research various coding tools to find the one that best suits my abilities. Although I initially considered using CSS variables, I found it to be too simple and decided to explore other options. As I continued to explore the Mild section on [SEP10 Tools List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rk-z-5FvFE3qHRHJ9q609wqwi3cQ9AKDW4H-CPG3WYA/edit), I narrowed down my options to two promising tools and stuck with it- **Animate.CSS** and **Wow.JS**

### Chosen Tool(s)

#### **_WowJS/AnimateCSS_**

##### [WowJS](https://wowjs.uk/): a Javascript library that generates CSS animations as you are scrolling on a webpage.

##### [AnimateCSS](https://animate.style/): a library with animations that allow you to animate your webpage in anyway you would like.


### Research Progress

Initially in class, I skimmed through the Wow.JS and Animate.CSS web pages. Without tinkering, I was asking myself if I would be interested in working with this tool. I did find these tools to be fun and interesting to apply so I continued my research! After that, I immediately watched this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_jHBk8Kzw ) to gain an understanding of this tool. The video was extremely helpful in terms of explaining things without me getting lost. As I was watching the video I would pause and replay in order to comprehend what was going on. To experiment with the tool, I made my attempt at tinkering by using [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/?html,css,output). First I started by inserting an h1 which was "Hello World". I forgot to install Animate.CSS into my webpage, for it to work I pasted this code using a CDN.

```
<head>
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css"
  />
</head>
```
I felt accomplishied because after I linked the code above and added my animation into the class, my text worked!

### Other sources used during my research

- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animations/Using_CSS_animations)
- [Youtube Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ygpdo7oE83E)

## Skills
In this fourth entry, I would like to reflect on two skills that I believe I touched on.

### Growth Mindset

During this entry, I kept my options open and considered all the tools that were available to us. I thought about whether I would enjoy working with each tool before making my final decision. My classmates and I freely shared our opinions about the different tools and had an open mindset about our ability to do well with our tools. I wasn’t hesitant during my research and made sure not to limit myself to what I could achieve before making my final decision.


### Debugging

As I was tinkering with my tool in jsbin, I got so excited that I forgot to install Animate.CSS on my webpage. I spent almost 30 minutes trying to find out if there were any typos or if I wrote the wrong code. Eventually, I realized that I missed the most important step and went straight into coding. This moment taught me to always prioritize important tasks and follow instructions correctly.


## Next Steps
Now I am ready to _**use WowJS/AnimateCSS**_ on my project.
