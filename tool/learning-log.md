* [HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-animation-not-working) is a website used to assist with problem solving css animation issues. In case I get stuck along the way I will go back to this site for reference.
  As I was reading through this website I copied and pasted the "Multiple Misaligned Animation Property Values" code into jsbin. I analyzed the different parts of the CSS and figured out what each line of code did. I also wanted to try and change the color of the content.

```
 @keyframes change-color {
  25% { color: #00A4BD; }
  50% { color: #FF7A59; }
  75% { color: #00BDA5; }
}
```
