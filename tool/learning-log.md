[HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-animation-not-working) is a website used to assist with problem solving CSS Animation issues. In case I get stuck along my LOYO journey, I will go back to this site for reference.

As I was reading through this website I copied and pasted the "Multiple Misaligned Animation Property Values" code into jsbin. Then I proceeded to analyze the CSS and figure out the significance each line of code has. 

*  animation-iteration-count → amount of times the animation repeats
*  word-spacing → the distance between each word as the animation is on


```
 @keyframes change-color {
  25% { color: #00A4BD; }
  50% { color: #FF7A59; }
  75% { color: #00BDA5; }
}
```
